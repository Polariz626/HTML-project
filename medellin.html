    <h2>Medellin</h2>


    <!-- about the colombian place shown in the image -->
    <p>
        Colombia’s second-biggest city was once considered the most dangerous in the world. But not anymore. Thanks to some imaginative civil projects and the will and resilience of local residents, Medellin has emerged from its shadowy past to become one of the best places to visit in Colombia.<br>
        <br>Dubbed the ‘city of eternal spring’, Medellin is located in a rich and fertile part of Colombia responsible for producing much of the country’s coffee, fruit and flowers. The city itself is surprisingly large—brick houses spread out for miles in every direction, best viewed from lookouts accessed via cable cars connected to the only metro system in Colombia.<br>
        <br>Highlights include the Museo de Casa de la Memoria, a tasteful homage to the city’s tumultuous past, and Comuna 13, a barrio that clings to the side of the hill and is home to Medellin’s best street art.<br>
        <br>Spend your days in Medellin visiting fresh food markets, sipping on freshly squeezed OJ and nibbling on empanadas local style. Or you can skip over to El Poblado, the city’s most affluent area, and enjoy the many restaurants. Take a stroll through Laureles, a delightful inner-city suburb filled with parks, cafes and bars.<br>
        <br>Take a selfie in Plaza Botero (which is lined with sculptures by the Medellin-born artist)—and if you’re lucky enough to be in town on the first weekend of the month, drop into the San Alejo Handicraft Market.<br>
        <br>Medellin is the biggest transport hub in Antioquia Department and a perfect departure point for exploring Colombia’s coffee belt and the small colonial towns that characterise this part of the country. It’s worth spending at least three days in the city itself—most of your time should be dedicated to eating and drinking.<br>
