    <h2>Raquira</h2>


    <!-- about the colombian place shown in the image -->
    <p>
        Raquira is as colourful as nearby Villa de Leyva is white. The brightly painted facades in this town bring a smile to your face, and you can easily spend a couple of hours wandering around as part of a day trip or stopover.<br>
        <br>This charming little village is widely known as the pottery capital of Colombia. Just about every piece of Colombian ceramic you can buy was made in this tiny town. So you know what to do if you have some spare room in your backpack. Fully packed? Indulge in a pottery workshop and return home with memories instead.<br>
        <br>Though pottery is dominant, it’s not the only type of souvenir you can buy in Raquira. All kinds of artisanías – from hammocks, to Mochilas (the pretty handwoven bags from Northern Colombia) and clothing – can be bought here for a fraction of the price you’d pay in Bogota.<br>
        <br>Buses leave for Raquira about five times daily from Villa de Leyva. It’s a 30 minute trip. Four hours is enough for lunch and to pick up some souvenirs. Try to sneak in a bit of people watching on the little plaza as well. A good day to visit is on Sunday, when the local market is in full swing.<br>
