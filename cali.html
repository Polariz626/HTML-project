    <h2>Cali</h2>

    <!-- about the colombian place shown in the image -->
    <p>
        Cali is best known by outsiders as the former home of the infamous Cali Cartel. Many travellers skip it without knowing this Colombian city is famous for something else as well. If you’re interested in learning how to salsa dance, Cali is considered the world capital of salsa. I spent two months there taking group salsa lessons in the afternoon and practicing what I learned at night at local haunts such as Tin Tin Deo.<br>
        <br>Colombians are some of the friendliest people in the world. They understand that everyone begins somewhere, and so you don’t need to be shy if you’re new to salsa. At the clubs I danced the night away and took shots of aguardiente with new friends, who taught me to how to fit in by learning Colombian slang.<br>
        <br>Cali is also home to the world salsa championships where you can watch kids as young as four and five years compete in individual or group events. It lasts several days over several venues and is a great way to see Cali from a local perspective.<br>
